## Today — Feb 10 (Tuesday)

- [ ] Open PhotoHouseAI codebase with Claude Code — assess what's broken (Stripe keys, credit system, deploy)
- [ ] Browse Idealista for El Campello listings — screenshot 5-10 ugly property photos (dark rooms, bad lighting, empty spaces)
- [ ] List what's needed for MVP: Stripe config, credit system wiring, deployment

## This Week — Feb 10-16

- [ ] PhotoHouseAI MVP sprint with Claude Code:
  - [ ] Configure Stripe keys and products (credit packs at €30-50/month)
  - [ ] Wire up credit system (purchase → use credits for AI enhancements)
  - [ ] Deploy to Vercel on housephotoai.com
- [ ] Run Idealista photos through the tool, save before/after comparisons
- [ ] Master's coursework as needed

## Rest of February

- [ ] Polish PhotoHouseAI end-to-end flow: upload → AI enhance → download
- [ ] Create demo material: before/afters saved on phone + simple one-page PDF or landing page
- [ ] **Walk into first 3-5 real estate offices in El Campello**
  - Script: "Hey, I live here in El Campello, I'm a developer. I built a tool that improves property photos with AI. Here's what it does — want to try it free?"
- [ ] Offer 10 free photos per interested agency — collect feedback
- [ ] DeskBreak: 30 min optimizing Chrome Web Store listing (screenshots, description, keywords)
- [ ] DeskBreak: Research LookAway's Reddit growth strategy — check r/remotework, r/productivity, r/WFH, r/ergonomics for organic posting patterns
- [ ] DeskBreak: Evaluate B2B pivot — team plans for companies (HR/People ops buy wellness tools). Scope: team dashboard, admin features, company billing. $5-15/employee/month.
- [ ] Fix directory SSL certs if Directify has resolved the DNS issue

## March

- [ ] Master's: still heavy, remains priority #1
- [ ] Iterate PhotoHouseAI based on agent feedback
  - What did they like?
  - What's missing? (Batch upload? Specific enhancement types? Virtual staging?)
  - Did they even care? If not — why?
- [ ] Walk into 5-10 more offices — cover all of El Campello
- [ ] Convert free trial users to paid (€30-50/month credit packs)
- [ ] **Target: 3 paying agencies by end of March**

## April

- [ ] Master's workload lightens
- [ ] PhotoHouseAI: expand to Alicante city (way bigger market, hundreds of agencies)
- [ ] Consider creating Google Business profile for PhotoHouseAI
- [ ] Sprint 1 (if time): TourGuideAI — polish + launch on Product Hunt before summer
- [ ] Keep interviewing for better roles

## May

- [ ] PhotoHouseAI: continue Alicante expansion
- [ ] Evaluate: how many paying agencies? Is MRR growing?
- [ ] Sprint 2 (if time): Guitar Practice Tracker MVP
- [ ] Master's: wrap up final coursework

## June-July

- [ ] PhotoHouseAI: if working → scale down the coast (Benidorm, Torrevieja, Santa Pola)
- [ ] Consider hiring a part-time sales person or using real estate Facebook groups
- [ ] Consider fixing FotoCV (broken emails/webhooks) — costs are pay-per-use, no upfront AI spend needed. Could also switch from Astria to cheaper providers (Replicate, Fal AI, etc.)
- [ ] Master's final project — try to make it useful as a product
- [ ] One more sprint if time (Guitar Practice Tracker)

## August

- [ ] **Mid-point review.** Hard look at the numbers:
  - Total paying agencies?
  - Monthly revenue?
  - Growth trend (up, flat, declining)?
  - Customer retention — are agencies staying?
  - Did any job interview lead to a better offer?
- [ ] If PhotoHouseAI is working: plan September push, consider raising prices
- [ ] If PhotoHouseAI isn't working: start mentally preparing to drop autonomo

## September

- [ ] Final push if there's momentum
- [ ] Prepare autonomo decision with accountant (TaxDown)
- [ ] Calculate: revenue vs. €300/month autonomo + running costs
- [ ] Factor in job situation — better salary changes the math

## October (D-Day)

| Revenue situation | Decision |
|-------------------|----------|
| ≥€300/month and growing | **Keep autonomo.** Real business. Scale it. |
| €100-300/month and growing | **Probably keep.** Trajectory matters. Give it 2-3 more months. |
| <€100/month after 8 months of trying | **Drop autonomo.** Focus on career. Re-register in 2-3 years if needed. |
| Landed a much better job | **Evaluate.** Maybe keep as insurance if salary removes pressure. |

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep |
|--------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| PhotoHouseAI MVP | Deploy | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Offices visited | 5 | 15 | 30 | 50 | 70 | 90 | 100+ | — |
| Free trial users | 3 | 5 | 10 | — | — | — | — | — |
| Paying agencies | 0 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |
| MRR (€) | 0 | 120 | 240 | 400 | 600 | 800 | 1000 | 1200 |

These are aspirational targets, not predictions. The real goal is to have enough data by September to make the autonomo decision confidently.
