# Complete Strategy: Making a Living as Indie Hacker by Oct 2026

## Answers to Your Specific Questions

### 1. Directify → DirStarter migration?
**No. Stay on Directify.** The value of a directory is the CONTENT (listings, SEO rankings), not the code. Migrating = spending time on infrastructure instead of marketing. You have a Directify lifetime license — use it. Only migrate if Directify has a specific feature gap blocking revenue (e.g., can't add sponsored listings, can't customize SEO). Fix the SSL certs and focus on adding content.

### 2. Small sprints on other projects to make them MVP-ready?
**Yes, BUT with a condition: each sprint must include a launch.** The pattern to break isn't "stop building" — it's "build AND launch AND market." Here's the compromise:

**The Marc Lou model adapted for you:**
- Sprint: Build/fix/launch a project in 2-5 days
- Launch: Post on Product Hunt + LinkedIn + Twitter
- Content: The sprint itself IS the content ("I built X in 3 days with AI")
- Evaluate: Did anyone care? If yes → invest more. If no → move on.

This works because:
- Each sprint creates content (LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads)
- Each launch tests market demand with zero marketing budget
- Building the "I ship fast" personal brand attracts freelance clients too
- You're already proven at building fast (Healthspan in 2 weeks)

**Sprint rules:**
- Maximum 3-5 days per sprint (including launch)
- Must have payments working before launch
- Must post about it publicly (LinkedIn minimum)
- If no traction after 2 weeks → move on, don't keep tweaking
- Maximum 1-2 sprints per month (save time for FotoCV/PhotoHouseAI marketing)

### 3. DeskBreak mobile/desktop expansion?
**Not now.** The Chrome extension's problem is distribution, not platform. Expanding to mobile/desktop creates 3 products nobody finds instead of 1. Only expand IF Chrome version hits meaningful revenue (€500+/month) and users request other platforms. Otherwise it's building for building's sake.

### 4. Which existing projects to sprint on?
See the sprint priority list below.

### 5. Notion ideas — which are worth building?
Reviewed your 50+ ideas. Most are too early or too niche. The ones worth considering are listed below.

## The Three-Track Strategy

Run these in parallel:

### Track A: Revenue Machines (60% of side time)
These are your existing products closest to revenue. Focus on MARKETING, not building.

| Priority | Project | What to do | Time |
|----------|---------|-----------|------|
| 1 | **FotoCV** | Fix emails/webhooks, write 5 SEO blog posts in Spanish | 2-3 weeks |
| 2 | **PhotoHouseAI** | Configure Stripe + credits with Claude Code, deploy, create before/after content | 2-3 days setup, then ongoing content |
| 3 | **SEO Directories** | Fix SSL, add sponsored listing tier, populate with more listings | 1-2 days, then ongoing |

### Track B: Sprint & Launch (20% of side time)
1-2 sprints per month on existing projects. Each sprint = fix → launch → post → evaluate.

**Sprint Priority List (by business potential + effort to ship):**

| Sprint | Project | What to do | Days | Why |
|--------|---------|-----------|------|-----|
| 1 | **TourGuideAI** | Polish, launch on Product Hunt before summer | 3-5 | 114 cities ready, Stripe works, summer timing |
| 2 | **Guitar Practice Tracker** (from Notion, 8.5 points) | Build MVP with Claude Code, launch | 3-5 | Personal passion (guitarist), $3/month SaaS, niche with loyal users |
| 3 | **Indie Hacker Game** | Make public, launch on Product Hunt / indie hacker communities | 1 | Already built, fun/shareable, brand building |
| 4 | **Vibe Coding Platform** | Add auth + payments, launch | 3-5 | AI coding is hot, 9/10 code quality, but competing with giants |

**Sprint candidates from Notion (if you have time after the above):**
- **Supermarket Prices Comparison** — Spain-specific, SEO potential for "comparador precios supermercado"
- **CPR Songs** — Niche but interesting (app to find CPR-rhythm songs)
- **Custom Mobile Apps for SMB appointments** — Productized service play

**NOT worth sprinting on:**
- Car Comparator (too generic, no monetization path)
- Music Inpainting / AI Melody Filler (no backend, no payments, niche)
- v0 for React Native / Remix (competing with well-funded companies)
- Food-related apps (NutritionPal, FoodMaps) — zero code, too competitive
- More directory ideas (you already have 5+ directories)
- Social Reminder (concept only, no clear market)
- Apply Logo to Anything (commoditized by Canva etc.)

### Track C: Build in Public (20% of side time)
This is your DISTRIBUTION channel. Without this, nothing else works.

| What | Where | Frequency |
|------|-------|-----------|
| "I built X in Y days" posts | LinkedIn | 1x/week |
| Sprint journey threads | Twitter/X | During sprints |
| SEO blog posts | FotoCV blog (Spanish) | 2x/month |
| Before/after content | Instagram/TikTok (PhotoHouseAI) | 2x/week when ready |

## The Bottom Line

You're not choosing between "build" and "market" — you need both. But the ratio matters:

**Current ratio:** 95% building, 5% marketing → 10 products, ~€0 revenue
**Target ratio:** 40% building (sprints), 40% marketing (SEO + social + launches), 20% maintaining

The sprint model works for you because:
1. You're genuinely fast (Healthspan in 2 weeks)
2. Each sprint creates content (posts about what you built)
3. Content builds an audience
4. Audience makes future launches more effective
5. Freelance clients come from the audience too

**Start posting on LinkedIn this week.** That's the single highest-ROI action. Everything else depends on having an audience to launch to.
