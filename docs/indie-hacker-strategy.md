# Indie Hacker Strategy — Feb to Oct 2026

> Last updated: February 2026
> Context: 8 months until autonomo discount expires. Decision time.

---

## Current Situation

- **Job:** Senior Frontend Dev at Token City (Oct 2024 - Present). Actively interviewing for better-paying roles.
- **Master's:** AI Development at Big School (ongoing, heavy workload Feb-Mar, winding down Apr-May)
- **Autonomo:** Paying ~€80/month (tarifa plana discount). Expires Oct 2026 → jumps to ~€300/month. If dropped, can't get the discount again for 2-3 years.
- **Side project revenue:** ~€0 after 1.5 years as autonomo. DeskBreak has had 5-6 paid users total and a couple yearly subscribers. That's it.
- **Available time:** 5-10 hrs/week outside job + Master's
- **Monthly costs eating into salary:** Claude Code Max, ChatGPT, TaxDown accountant, autonomo, Master's payments, plus tried Outrank.so + Revid.ai (~€100/month) for SEO/video automation — all adding up to nearly a third of salary.

### What's been tried (and what didn't work)
- **Twitter/X marketing:** Only attracted other indie hackers, not actual target users (job seekers, office workers, real estate agents)
- **Paid automation tools (Outrank.so, Revid.ai):** ~€100+/month, no meaningful results. Dropped.
- **Building more products:** 10+ shipped projects, great code quality, near-zero revenue. The problem was never the building.

### The core lesson
The problem isn't the products — it's reaching the RIGHT people through the RIGHT channels. Twitter reaches indie hackers. Spanish job seekers use Google. Office workers find Chrome extensions in the Web Store. Real estate agents are in physical offices on the street. Each product needs its own distribution channel, and most of them aren't Twitter.

## The Big Decisions

### Priority #1: PhotoHouseAI (the main bet)

**Why PhotoHouseAI over everything else:**

- **B2B > B2C** — Real estate agents have money and clear ROI (better photos = sell properties faster). Job seekers pay €5 once. Office workers might pay $2/month for a break reminder. Agents will pay €30-50/month without blinking.
- **Local market advantage** — El Campello and Alicante are booming real estate markets (expats, tourism, coastal property). 20+ real estate offices on the daily beach walk alone. New ones opening regularly. Alicante city has hundreds more.
- **The product sells itself** — Before/after property photo comparisons are visually undeniable. Dark living room → bright, staged photo. Agents get it instantly.
- **Distribution is free and natural** — Walk into offices on the beach walk. No SEO, no Twitter, no paid tools. "Hey, I live here, I'm a developer, I built this tool. Here's what it does. Want to try it free?" That's not sales — it's showing your work.
- **Quick to MVP** — Template (Supastarter) is very complete. Configure Stripe + credits with Claude Code, deploy. Couple of weekends.
- **Higher ticket** — €30-50/month per agency vs €5 one-time (FotoCV) vs €2/month (DeskBreak)

**The math:** 5 agencies at €40/month = €200/month. 10 agencies = €400/month. That covers autonomo at full price and then some. And that's just El Campello — haven't touched Alicante, Benidorm, Torrevieja, or the rest of the coast.

**Next steps:**
1. Get PhotoHouseAI working — Stripe + credits + deploy (1-2 weekends with Claude Code)
2. Create 5-10 before/after examples from Idealista listings in El Campello
3. Walk into 5 offices with before/afters on phone
4. Offer free trial (10 photos free), then €30-50/month credit pack
5. If it works in El Campello → expand to Alicante city, then coast

### Priority #2: Finish the Master's

Non-negotiable. The AI credential helps whether you stay indie or land a better job. Heavy Feb-Mar, lighter Apr-May. Don't sacrifice this for side projects — the Master's has guaranteed career value, side projects are speculative.

### Priority #3: Job interviews

Keep interviewing. A salary jump from a better company is the most reliable income increase. The Master's + portfolio (Healthspan, 10 shipped projects, AI experience) makes you a strong candidate for senior/lead roles. This runs in parallel and doesn't conflict with anything.

### Priority #4 (background): DeskBreak passive income

Don't invest more time building. It has paying users — let it run. The one thing worth doing: optimize the Chrome Web Store listing (screenshots, description, keywords). That's where office workers discover extensions, not Twitter. 30-minute task, then leave it alone.

### Priority #5 (on hold): FotoCV

**Deprioritized.** Initially seemed like the top bet because CVPhoto.app is a proven $2K/month model. But:
- Running costs are €400-600/month for AI processing (Astria) before any revenue
- Low ticket price (€5-10 per photo) — needs volume
- Emails/webhooks broken — needs fixing before it can function
- Spanish SEO would take months to rank
- No blog posts written yet

**Not dead, just parked.** If PhotoHouseAI takes off and generates cash flow, FotoCV becomes a good second product to invest in. The proven model is real — it just needs more upfront investment than PhotoHouseAI to get running.

### Deprioritized: Everything else

These are all lower priority than PhotoHouseAI. Some could become sprint candidates later (Apr-May when Master's winds down), but NOT now.

## All Projects — Final Verdict

### Active Focus
| Project | Action | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **PhotoHouseAI** | MVP sprint → local sales in El Campello | B2B, local advantage, high ticket, free distribution |

### Keep Running (zero time investment)
| Project | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **DeskBreak Chrome** | Passive income | 5-6 paid users, couple yearly subs. Optimize Web Store listing (30 min), then hands off. |
| **Healthspan** | Portfolio flagship | Best portfolio piece (1,475 tests, full SaaS). Don't touch, just showcase in interviews. |
| **Centro Dharma** | Delivered | Live client site. Done. |
| **Band Finder** | Portfolio | University thesis. Public repo for interviews. |
| **Portfolio site** | Live | miguelfernandez.dev on Astro 5. Already great. Visual overhaul plan exists for later polish. |

### Sprint Candidates (Apr-May, after Master's lightens)
| Project | Sprint effort | Potential | Notes |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------|
| **TourGuideAI** | 3-5 days | Seasonal (summer) | 114 cities, Stripe works. Launch on Product Hunt before June. |
| **Guitar Practice Tracker** | 3-5 days | Niche SaaS | From Notion ideas (8.5 points). Personal passion, $3/month, loyal niche. |
| **Indie Hacker Game** | 1 day (just launch) | Brand building | Already built. Post on indie hacker communities. |
| **Vibe Coding Platform** | 3-5 days | Hot market | Add auth + payments. But competing with giants (Cursor, Bolt, etc.) |

### On Hold (revisit if PhotoHouseAI generates cash)
| Project | Why on hold |
|---------|-------------|
| **FotoCV** | High running costs, broken emails, needs SEO months to rank. Good model but needs investment. |
| **SEO Directories** (5 on Directify) | Fix SSL when Directify resolves it. Passive content play. Not urgent. |

### Investigate Later
| Project | Question |
|---------|----------|
| **ObraGest** | Construction is booming in Spain. RevenueCat subs ready. But co-founder left — can you run it alone? |
| **PlanMark** | Same question. |

### Dead / Sunset
| Project | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Game Portrait | Expire domain. AI art market commoditized. |
| ImgStudioAI | Redundant with PhotoHouseAI. |
| LaunchTone | No clear path to revenue. |
| AI Branding | Too generic. |
| DeskBreak Desktop/Mobile/VSCode | Don't expand what isn't growing. |
| Flight Tracker | Hobby project, no market. |
| Car Calculator/Comparator | Too generic, no monetization. |
| Food Comparator/NutritionPal/FoodMaps | Zero code, too competitive. |
| Social Reminder | Concept only. |
| Apply Logo to Anything | Commoditized by Canva. |
| Music Inpainting / AI Melody Filler | No backend, no payments, too niche. |
| v0 for React Native / Remix | Competing with well-funded companies. |
| Viber3D | No clear market. |
| More directory ideas | Already have 5+. |

### Notion Ideas — Worth considering later
| Idea | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Guitar Practice Tracker** | 8.5 | Sprint candidate for Apr-May |
| **Supermarket Prices Comparison** | — | Spain-specific, SEO potential ("comparador precios supermercado") |
| **CPR Songs** | — | Niche but interesting |
| **Custom Mobile Apps for SMB** | — | Productized service play |

Everything else in the 50+ Notion ideas: too early, too niche, or already done better by someone else.

## Autonomo Decision Framework

**The question in October:** Are side projects generating ≥€300/month?

| Scenario | Decision |
|----------|----------|
| PhotoHouseAI has 8+ paying agencies | **Keep autonomo.** You have product-market fit. Scale to Alicante city. |
| PhotoHouseAI has 3-7 agencies + growing | **Probably keep.** Trajectory matters. If growing month-over-month, worth the investment. |
| PhotoHouseAI has 0-2 agencies after trying | **Drop autonomo.** You gave it a real shot with the right channel. Focus on career. Re-register in 2-3 years if something takes off. |
| Landed a much better job (big salary jump) | **Evaluate.** If new salary removes financial pressure, maybe keep autonomo as cheap insurance even at €300/month. |

**Important:** Dropping autonomo isn't failure. It's a business decision. You can still build side projects — you just can't invoice for them. If a project later explodes, re-register then.

## Cost Management

### Cut immediately
- ~~Outrank.so~~ (~€50/month) — already dropped
- ~~Revid.ai~~ (~€50/month) — already dropped
- Any other paid marketing tools that aren't converting

### Keep (justified)
- **Claude Code Max** — use for PhotoHouseAI sprint AND day job. Dual value.
- **TaxDown** — need accountant while autonomo is active
- **Autonomo** — €80/month until Oct, then decide
- **Master's payments** — non-negotiable, finishing

### Evaluate
- **ChatGPT subscription** — do you need both ChatGPT and Claude Code Max? If Claude covers your needs, consider dropping one.
- **Domain renewals** — see domain decisions below

## Monthly Timeline: Feb → Oct 2026

### February-March (Master's heavy + PhotoHouseAI MVP)
- **Master's:** Priority. Heavy coursework period.
- **PhotoHouseAI:** 1-2 weekends — set up Stripe, credits, deploy with Claude Code
- **PhotoHouseAI:** Create 5-10 before/after examples from Idealista El Campello listings
- **PhotoHouseAI:** Walk into first 5 real estate offices
- **DeskBreak:** One 30-min session to optimize Chrome Web Store listing
- **Quick:** Fix directory SSL if Directify resolves the issue

### April-May (Master's winding down + PhotoHouseAI growth + first sprint)
- **PhotoHouseAI:** Expand to more El Campello offices, start Alicante city
- **PhotoHouseAI:** Iterate based on agent feedback (what features do they want?)
- **Sprint 1:** TourGuideAI — polish + launch on Product Hunt before summer
- **Evaluate:** How many paying PhotoHouseAI agencies? Is there growth?

### June-July (More time available)
- **PhotoHouseAI:** Scale if working. Benidorm, Torrevieja, rest of coast.
- **Sprint 2:** Guitar Practice Tracker or Vibe Coding Platform
- **Master's final project:** Use as next product if possible
- **FotoCV:** Consider fixing if PhotoHouseAI is generating cash to cover running costs

### August-September (Decision time)
- **Hard look at the numbers.** Is PhotoHouseAI making €300+/month?
- **If yes:** Keep autonomo. You have a real business. Consider FotoCV as second product.
- **If no:** Prepare to drop autonomo in October. No shame — focus on career.
- **Job situation:** Did interviews lead to a better offer? Factor salary into autonomo math.

### October (D-Day)
- **Keep or drop autonomo** based on revenue trajectory
- **Either way:** You have a Master's in AI, 10+ shipped projects, interview experience, and you actually tried the right marketing channels this time

---

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Building ≠ Revenue.** 10 shipped products, near-zero revenue. The bottleneck was always distribution, not code quality.
2. **Wrong channel = wasted effort.** Twitter reaches indie hackers, not customers. Each product's users live somewhere specific — find that place.
3. **Paid automation tools are a trap at pre-revenue stage.** €100+/month for Outrank + Revid with no results. Use Claude Code (already paying for it) to create content manually.
4. **B2B local > B2C global.** One real estate agent paying €40/month > 100 job seekers who might pay €5 once. Especially when the agents are literally on your daily walk.
5. **The best distribution channel for PhotoHouseAI is your feet.** Walk into offices. Show before/afters. Let the product sell itself.
6. **Don't spread across 10 projects.** Focus on one (PhotoHouseAI), let the rest run passively or wait.

---

## The Bottom Line

**One product. One channel. Eight months.**

PhotoHouseAI + walking into El Campello real estate offices. That's the play.

Everything else is secondary: Master's runs in parallel (non-negotiable), job interviews continue (safety net), DeskBreak collects passive income, other projects wait their turn.

If 8 months of selling to local real estate agents doesn't work, drop autonomo knowing you finally tried the right approach — not more building, not Twitter, not paid tools — but actually talking to customers who have money and a problem you solve.
