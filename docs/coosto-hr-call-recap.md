# HR Call Recap - Tessa (Feb 9, 2026)

## What Tessa Covered
- Coosto product/business overview: modules, functionalities, marketing, target clients
- Team structure: ~80-90 people in Netherlands, ~10 in Alicante
- Maarten is the manager
- Tech stack: Vue + TypeScript, Scrum with daily meetings
- Said to ask more tech details in today's meeting with the tech people

## Personal Intro (both shared)
- Age, hobbies, family, where they live, education, current job
- Tessa started, then Miguel followed

## Experience Discussion
- Natural conversational flow, not strictly chronological
- Covered all previous roles

## Senior Title Question
Tessa noticed CV doesn't show Mid/Medior progression before Senior title.
Miguel's defense (well received):
- Full code ownership from early career (Doctomatic startup)
- Hired as Senior at MetaEnlace/INDITEX
- Became main Frontend in sub-team at INDITEX, mentored new devs
- Reference for task estimations due to project knowledge
- At Token City: sole Frontend engineer, all architectural decisions
- "It's about scope of ownership, not just years"

## Company Size Preference (key moment)
- Miguel mentioned experience in both extremes: chaotic startup (Doctomatic) and rigid corporate (INDITEX)
- Said he doesn't prefer either extreme
- **Tessa said "perfect because we're in the middle"** - mature product, Scrum, multiple modules, not a startup anymore
- Natural alignment moment

## Salary Discussion
- Miguel said: 35K gross/year (actually at 33K, expecting raise to ~35K, colleagues got 2-3K raises)
- Wanted to grow/improve from that number
- Tessa said: normal, within the range they're thinking for the position
- Will give specific range/number after technical assessment (today's meeting)
- Note: Backend senior range was €3,800-4,700/month (€45.6K-56.4K/year)

## Notice Period
- 15 days (standard Spain) - attractive for them since replacing someone leaving

## Aitor Reference
- Tessa asked if Aitor told him about the company/stack
- Miguel kept it minimal, asked Tessa to explain from scratch since no public job posting

## Motivation for Change
- "Exploring new opportunities and new projects to grow as professional and developer"
- Did NOT badmouth Token City
- Did NOT mention salary as primary motivator
