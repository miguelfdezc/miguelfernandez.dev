### Observed in 2nd Interview (Feb 11)
- **Visibly shy/uncomfortable** — explicitly said at the start that he doesn't do this kind of interview, isn't used to judging people, doesn't know what people usually say
- Quieter as expected — let Maarten lead, interjected with precise technical points
- Explained the stack clearly: Vue + TS custom toolkit (no Nuxt), Vite, Vitest, Vuex still in parts
- Mentioned component library documented with VitePress (possibly Tailwind — hard to understand accent)
- Honest about lacking test coverage (good sign — values honesty)
- **Vue vs React question:** Expected Miguel to have a strong opinion for one side, said he wouldn't judge either way. Miguel gave diplomatic answer about similarities in latest versions
- Confirmed Aitor's description: shy, precise, values honest technical discussion
- **Key insight for 3rd round:** Pim is NOT a natural interviewer. He'll likely be more comfortable in a case study / code discussion format where he can talk about actual code rather than "interview questions"

### What Pim Will Evaluate (3rd round - problem solving test)
- Technical Vue.js depth (Composition API, reactivity, patterns)
- Frontend architecture understanding (component design, state management decisions)
- TypeScript proficiency
- Code quality mindset
- Problem-solving approach (how you reason through scenarios)
- Testing strategy
- UI/UX sensibility
- **Note:** Pim joins ONLINE for this round (Francisco is in person)
